Your task is to act as a Senior Systems Architect. 
1. Open and read the @SPEC.md file to understand the current starting point.
2. You must NOT start coding yet. Instead, initiate a detailed interview.
3. Use the terminal to ask me (the user) probing questions about:
    - Technical implementation details.
    - UI/UX requirements.
    - Potential edge cases and trade-offs.
4. Ask only 1-2 questions at a time to keep the conversation manageable.
5. Continue this loop until you have enough information to create a professional, comprehensive technical specification.
6. Once complete, rewrite the @SPEC.md with the final, detailed version.
